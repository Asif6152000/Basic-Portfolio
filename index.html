        <p class="juma">Hi my name is Asif Kabir. My family is originally from Calcutta, India but I was raised in Georgia my whole life. I gradauted 
        from Mill Creek High School in 2009. I then attended Georgia Gwinnett College and got a Bachelor's degree in Business Administrative.
        Once I graduated, I worked as a mortgage loan originator. After two years, I decided to attend graduate school and got a Master's in 
        Business Administration. Once I finished my Master's, I decided to change careers and that is why I am here today. I am very 
        excited to become a Full Stack Web Developer. </p>
